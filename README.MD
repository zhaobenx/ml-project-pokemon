## Proposal

* Problems trying to solve:

If you area Pokémon Go player, you may be interested in the Pokémon catch rate. We want to use machine learning methods to predict Pokémon properties and analyze the catch rates accurately for the huge number of Pokémon in the game. 

* Ideas for approaches: 


For Pokémon catch rate analysis,we can try Linear Regression,Random Forest and Decision Tree methods. For Pokémon attribute classification,we can try Logistic Regression,SVM, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree methods.We will compare the accuracy obtained from these different methods and choose the optimum results. 

* Referencecode: 

[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) We will use this page as a  starting point to guide us in choosing the proper estimators. We will also refer to the python package documentations as our tutorial to choose the appropriate function and syntax for our project.

## Code and report

The code and the dataset can be found under the `src` folder [pokemon_analyze.ipynb](./src/pokemon_analyze.ipynb)， and there is also a pdf vision of this `ipynb`. Other files in this folder is used for developing.

The report can be found  [report_final.pdf](report_final.pdf) .
